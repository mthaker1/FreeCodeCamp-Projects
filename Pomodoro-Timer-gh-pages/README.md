# Pomodoro-Timer
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique that can increase the user's productivity. The Pomodoro Technique was designed to help users keep away from distractions, complete tasks in short bursts and allows users to take frequent breaks to get some fresh air and relax after a productive working phase. 

In the pomodoro technique, users go through 25 minute intervals with a 5 minute break in between each. After about five-six 25 minute interval seissons, the user gets a 15 minute break. The user continues this technique until the work is completed. The pomodoro technique is supported by research, which finds that productive periods for the human attention span last about 20-25 minutes.
