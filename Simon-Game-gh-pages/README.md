Built using HTML5,CSS, Bootstrap V4 Framework, JavaScript, and JQuery. 

Functions of the program include:
1) A light and sound animation for each individual button and is executed when both the player and the program is displaying the series of button presses.

2) If a user plays in regular mode and presses the wrong button, the user is notified that they have done so and the pattern is repeated, allowing the user another chance to input the correct series of buttons.

3) If a user plays in strict mode and presses the wrong button, the user is notified they have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.

4) The user can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. The player is notified of their victory, and is prompted to start over.
